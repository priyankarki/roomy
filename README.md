---------

Inspired by IKEA Kreativ, which allows users to plan the furniture for their spaces using IKEA furniture. Roomy is a small scale version of the same idea, implemented using A-Frame and Meta Quest 3. 

**Key features:**
* Spawn objects — Using the right Quest controller, the user is able to select, place, and scale items.
* Menu of objects — The objects are from either Sketchfab or PolyHaven, converted into GLTF files using Blender.
* Manipulating objects — Using the left Quest controller, the user is able to delete the unwanted object and select it to be bigger/smaller.

**Future work:**
* Manipulating objects' textures and colors, without having to change it in code.
* Outdoor version for gardens/backyard planning.
